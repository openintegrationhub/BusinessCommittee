## Introduction

Dealing with data synchronization, data privacy is an important topic for us and anyone using the framework. As the Open Integration Hub is a framework, that can be used in various ways and implemented fully or just partially, each Integration Provider is of course responsible for their own platforms. 

Data privacy often goes hand in hand with data security. This workgroup focusses on privacy, as the technical security is a topic every developer and every workgroup within the project is concerned about. It also has to be embedded in every service, so the responsibility lays with each developer.

We do our best to ensure compliance of the actual services with legislation and provide all technical options for anyone to be compliant. Our focus so far is on GDPR, as most partners are based within the EU. 

We also provide best practices for the implementation of the Open Integration Hub framework. Furthermore we try to create the framework in a way, that might even make it easier for you or your customers to comply with GDPR.
