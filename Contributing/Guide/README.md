## Issues

For any issue (suggestion, bug, fix, etc.) there are fundamentally two ways an individual can contribute:

 - By helping to triage the issue: This can be done either by providing supporting details (a test case that demonstrates a bug), or providing suggestions on how to address the issue.
 - By helping to resolve the issue: Typically this is done either in the form of demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more often, by opening a Pull Request that changes some bit of something in Open Integration Hub in a concrete and reviewable manner.

# Where to contribute

## Understanding the structure 

The project is build by many enthusiasts from various backgrounds, countries and skillsets. To bring all of us together and work effectively, organization and structure is needed. To know where to get involved best, please take the time to understand how we work. 

## Committees

Committees are groups of elected Committers, responsible for the operative business and defining, prioritizing and executing all tasks necessary to achieve the project's goals and to ensure a steady development. Committees set up workgroups for specific topics and function as escalation layer for problems within these workgroup. For more information, please see the Open Integration Hub Charter. 

We currently have two Committees, which are a good entry point for you, if are looking for something to work on.

Technology Committee responsible for the development of the framework, it's releases and management of the process via the product backlog.

Business Committee responsible for all community-facing topics, as well as topics relevant for commercial use of the framework.

## Workgroups

- Each workgroup has at least one status call every two weeks
- Every **Committer** of that workgroup **must attend** the status call
- Decisions within a workgroup are made by all committers (unanimously)
- If it is not possible to decide on a certain issue/topic it must be escalated to the corresponding committee
