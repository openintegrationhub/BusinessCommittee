# The Contributor License Agreement

The [Cloud Ecosystem](https://www.cloudecosystem.org) defines
the legal status of the contributed code in two different types of _Contributor License Agreements_
(CLAs), [individual contributors](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/BusinessCommittee/blob/Contribution-Guide/Contributing/Guide/Contributor%20License%20Agreement%20INDIVIDUAL.pdf) and [companies](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/BusinessCommittee/blob/Contribution-Guide/Contributing/Guide/Contributor%20License%20Agreement%20COMPANY.pdf).

The Open Integration Hub Project can only accept original source code from CLA signatories.

It is important to read and understand this legal agreement.
