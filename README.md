# Business Committee


## Introduction

An active community is key for long term development and success of the Open Integration Hub. The Business Committee is responsible for all community-facing topics, as well as topics relevant for commercial use of the framework. We aim for making interactions easier, more productive and fun.

The Business Committee is a formal body of the Open Integration Hub Project as laid out in the Open Integration Hub Charter. Alongside the Technology Committee we manage operative execution of all tasks necessary to achieve the strategic goals defined by the Board and community.

The current initiatives are:
* Evangelism
* Website Optimization
